What did you like about this project?
It was kind of easy. Ample material was given (i.e. CodeAcademy tutorial) and it was very helpful.

What did you struggle with in this project?
The questions given by CodeAcademy is quite open-ended. Sometimes, it's not exacly clear what what they want the answer to be or what they want us to output.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Make the output requirements for each question clearer.
